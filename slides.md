# Automated release notes

_Conventional commits_ + _Semantic versioning_ + _Semantic&nbsp;Release_ to the rescue ðŸ’– !

---

# Conventional Commits ?

Explicit, standardised git commit history

---

## Git commit message with a specific format

```
Type (Scope): Subject

Optional body message
```

--- 

## Git commit message examples

```
fix(website): fixed header bug under android 6
-
feat(HAD2-1981): new pilaster calculation
-
chore: add docker container section in the README
- 
feat(api): added the JWT token check

BREAKING CHANGE: the API now requires a JWT token from the frontend
```

But but...My devs aren't disciplined enough to use conventional commits ! ðŸ˜°

![w:600](https://i.imgur.com/HGptyBE.gif)

How can I force them to use it ?

---

~~Forcefully~~ Convince them to add a **Git hook** to automagically validate the repo's commit message format ðŸ¤“

# Git related recommendation

* squash your commits when making merge requests/pull requests

# Semantic Versioning

A version number scheme that is telling us what has been modified within its underlying code

---

Here is the _Visual Studio Code_ latest version: `1.48.2`

Its numbering structure: `<Major>.<Minor>.<Patch>`

| Version part | What                                               | Before | After |

| Major        | Introduce a new **backward-incompatible** change   | 1.0.0  | 2.0.0 |
| Minor        | Introduce a new **backward-compatible** change     | 1.0.0  | 1.1.0 |
| Patch        | Fix a bug while maintaining backward-compatibility | 1.0.0  | 1.0.1 |

# Local demo time !

# What's next ?

* Figure out how we can use it for a dotnet/mobile project
* Figure out how we can use it within Azure Devops continuous integration ðŸ˜±
